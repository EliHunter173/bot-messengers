# Text Generator

A non-semantic random text generator that uses a custom JSON dictionary to store and organize valid
words.

A small selection of predefined dictionaries are present in the `data/` subdirectory of this
project. However, custom dictionaries could be easily defined as long as they conform to the
standard described [here](#creating-custom-dictionaries)

This is used in conjunction with my [TweeterBot](https://github.com/EliHunter173/bot-messengers)
and cron to periodically produce silly tweets on my personal Twitter
([@EliHunter173](https://twitter.com/EliHunter173)).
